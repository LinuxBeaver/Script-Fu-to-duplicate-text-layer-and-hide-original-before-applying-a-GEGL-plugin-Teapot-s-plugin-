## -- BEAVER DID NOT MAKE THIS TOOL IT WAS MADE BY TEAPOT ON GIMPCHAT --

This Script-fu does three commands.

   1. Hide Original Text layer
   2. Duplicate Text Layer (that's visible)
   3. Layer to Image Size Duplicate text layer

It goes in the normal scripts folder
/home/USERNAME/.config/GIMP/2.10/scripts

You will find it in Filters>Generic

This is the first Github page of mine to feature I tool I had no part in creating.
